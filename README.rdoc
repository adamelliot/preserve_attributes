= PreserveAttributes

Preserve attributes allows you to specify attributes in you ActiveRecord that
won't get set if you update them with nil. This becomes useful if you have
a form where you are submitting images and subsequent calls are wiping out 
images that were previously updated. This can also be useful in user admin
forms where you want to preserve the user's password but allow them to update
other fields in their account.

NOTE: This method currently only applies to update_attributes, not save.

== Example

  class User << ActiveRecord::Base
    preserve_attributes_if_nil :password, :avatar
  end
